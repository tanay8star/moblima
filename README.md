# MOBLIMA
This repository is the first command line application developed by me and a team of my friends for the module Object Oriented Programming (CZ2002).

This application aims to mimic the actions of a booking application for a movie theater. It allows for customers to book movie seats with a wide variety of functions, even with dynamic pricing! Additonally, there is a complex admininistrative side to this application as well that allows them to control movies, show timings, show locations, holidays and so much more!

Using Java, we were able to take a in-depth look into Object Oriented Programming and fully use the concepts taught in class in order todevelop the applciation.
